JOHANNESBURG, May 15 – Two former Fidelity security guards were sentenced to nine years each in the Makhado Magistrate’s Court in Limpopo this week for stealing R2,9 million cash within two months. A spokesman for the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) Captain Matimba Maluleke said the pair, Tinyiko Thomas Maluleke, 41, and Rofhiwa Emmanuel Luvhimbi, 31,  failed to make deposits after collecting cash from retailers and instead pocketed it between December last year and January. “The theft was reported by their manager after Maluleke and Luvhimbi failed to account for the missing money. An operation comprising the Hawks’ serious organised crime investigation and crime intelligence was tasked to investigate the matter. Almost R2.7 million was recovered when they were arrested separately in Ravel Riverside area and in Waterval just outside Elim,” Maluleke said on Wednesday. Investigators searched three different locations and found banknotes buried in yards, with some of it stashed in ice-cream containers and refuse bags while underground. One of the two men had already spent some of the cash and bought an SUV vehicle and building material, which were confiscated by the investigating team, said Maluleke. – African News Agency (ANA)
