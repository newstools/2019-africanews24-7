PARLIAMENT, May 22 – African National Congress (ANC) member of Parliament (MP) Thandi Modise was on Wednesday afternoon formally elected as Speaker of the National Assembly. Modise went up against Democratic Alliance MP Thembekile Richard Majola, a former Speaker of the Western Cape Legislature. Modise, former National Council of Provinces chairwoman, emerged victorious after the ANC used its majority to secure her as the national legislature’s boss for the next five or so years. The outcome of the secret ballot was 250 votes in favour of Modise, meaning the ANC had help in voting her into power. The DA’s Majola received 83 votes. There were 17 spoilt ballots. Economic Freedom Fighters MPs abstained from the vote. – African News Agency (ANA
