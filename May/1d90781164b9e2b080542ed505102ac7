PARLIAMENT, May 22 – The African National Congress (ANC) on Wednesday confirmed that Nomvula Mokonyane would not be returning to Parliament. In a statement from ANC secretary general Ace Magashule, he agrees to the former minister’s request that the party reconsiders her deployment to Parliament as an MP. On Monday, the party announced she had been appointed as the chair of chairs for the party. “Comrade Nomvula has since advised the ANC that due to family responsibilities and her being in mourning currently, she believes she would be unable to diligently and with commitment, fulfil her duties at this stage,” Wednesday’s statement said. The statement came as new MPs were taking their oath in the National Assembly, a fortnight after national elections. “The ANC will in due course redetermine the deployment of a replacement to the position of house chairperson.” Mokonyane, a former minister of environmental affairs, faces allegations that she took gifts from Bosasa, the latest company embroiled in allegations of massive corruption involving state funds. – African News Agency (ANA)
