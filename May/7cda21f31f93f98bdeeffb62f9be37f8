JOHANNESBURG, May 22 – The ruling African National Congress said on Wednesday it had received and agreed to a request by its deputy president David Mabuza to postpone his swearing in as a member of the national assembly later in the day. It said Mabuza, who is also the country’s deputy president, had made the request in light of a report by the party’s integrity commission in which he is alleged to have prejudiced the integrity of the organisation and brought it into disrepute. “The deputy president has indicated he would like to have an opportunity to address the Integrity Commission on these allegations,” ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa, who is also leader of the country, said in a statement. “In the meantime, he has decided nevertheless to follow the dictates of his conscience and postpone his swearing in as a member of the national assembly out of respect for the ANC’s institutions and processes.” Ramaphosa said the ANC commended Mabuza for the stance he had taken, adding: “I personally applaud his resolve to put the interests of the ANC first.” – African News Agency (ANA)
