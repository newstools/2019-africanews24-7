JOHANNESBURG, May 8 – Former president Kgalema Motlanthe on Wednesday said he was confident that the African National Congress (ANC) would emerge victorious in the elections and also retain power in Gauteng. Motlanthe was speaking on Wednesday after casting his vote at Killarney Country Club. He said he did not see the need for a coalition in Gauteng because the ANC would win. The party had campaigned hard in the province to get a clear majority. “If it happens that in Gauteng we lose we will take it from there but for now the ANC will win,” said Motlanthe. The former president placed his ballot paper in a voting box in front of spectators and the media after waiting in a long queue with other voters for an hour. He explained why he chose to do so. “If you jump the queue in this respect, what stops you from jumping the queue in all other respects. It’s the right thing to do”. Motlanthe was wife his wife Gugu and chatted and joked with fellow voters. He said he was hoping people would exercise their rights by casting their votes. (ANA)
