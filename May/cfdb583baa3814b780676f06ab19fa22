Barcelona – Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann will leave the club at the end of the season, he revealed on social media on Tuesday. Griezmann posted a video in which he said: “After talking with Cholo (coach, Diego Simeone) and then with Miguel Angel (Gil, club chief executive) I wanted to talk to you – the fans who have always given me so much affection. “I wanted to tell that you that I have made the decision to leave and to do other things, other challenges.” Media in Spain have reported in recent weeks that Griezmann’s release clause is due to drop from 200 million euros (224 million dollars) to 120 million euros on July 1. The player made no mention of his next destination but Barcelona are favourites to sign him. The 28-year-old almost signed for Barcelona last summer but choose to stay at Atletico Madrid. His last game will be away to Levante this weekend. In the message posted on Atletico Madrid’s official Twitter account and re-tweeted by the player, he added: “It has been five incredible years. I have always tried to give everything on the pitch. Thanks to everyone from my heart.” -(dpa)
