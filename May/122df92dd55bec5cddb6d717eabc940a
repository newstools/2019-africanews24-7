Sello Theletsane JOHANNESBURG- With the ANC having won national elections, albeit, with a reduced percentage, the focus is now on the party’s secretary general Ace Magashule. Africa News 24-7 has learned from impeccable sources that some ANC top officials in Gauteng are mobilising with the assistance of some President Cyril Ramaphosa supporters to unseat Magashule, who does not see eye to eye with Ramaphosa. Tension between Magashule and Ramaphosa intensified after ANC elections head Fikile Mbalula, Ramaphosa’s newest supporter attributed the ANC’s victory to Ramaphosa’s popularity, an assertion that was quickly dismissed by Magashule, who said the victory could not be attributed to a single individual. “What would be interesting to see is how the Constitution of the ANC could be interpreted to achieve this,” said a source close to one of the ANC top six members. “It becomes a serious problem when leaders do not understand the ANC, let alone its Constitution,” said the source. Africa News 24-7 can reveal that yesterday, a Top Six meeting was held where Magashule and his deputy, Jessie Duarte were not invited. The source said at this meeting, plans to remove Magashule and Cabinet posts were discussed. The source said the ANC secretary general’s office was snubbed because Ramaphosa wants to handle all deployments to the cabinet by himself. This is a developing story. Africa News 24-7 has sent questions to the ANC and will update the story as soon as the party has responded.
