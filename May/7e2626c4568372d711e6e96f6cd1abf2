LONDON, May 7 – Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, has given birth to a boy, the Duke of Sussex announced here on Monday. Prince Harry said the baby was delivered at 05:26 BST and both the mother and baby were doing “incredibly well.” He added that they were “absolutely thrilled” and they were still thinking about names for the infant. “This little thing is absolutely to die for, so I’m just over the moon,” the new father said. The Buckingham Palace said the baby weighed about 3.2 kg and the royal family have been informed. The baby boy, who is Queen Elizabeth’s eighth great-grandchild, is seventh in line to the throne, behind the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and his children – Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis – and Prince Harry. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were married on May 19 last year at Windsor Castle and became the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Last October, the Kensington Palace announced that the duchess was pregnant. (Xinhua)
