JOHANNESBURG, January 14 – Arts and culture minister Nathi Mthethwa said on Monday he had asked his attorneys to initiate legal action against Kwaito artist Eugene Mthethwa for remarks made against him at the memorial service of late musician Dan Tshanda. Speaking at the service in Newtown in Johannesburg, the Kwaito artist said he had been warned by a friend that his life would be in danger if he set foot in the coastal city of Durban, where the ruling African National Congress launched its manifesto at the weekend. The artist said the minister was not happy over public comments he made last year. Minister Mthethwa said the remarks were defamatory and a blatant attempt to cause harm and impairment to the dignity and integrity of his person and office. The allegations were extremely harmful and warranted his decision to seek relief from the courts of law, the minister added. “It is deeply troubling that one would abuse a platform meant to eulogise and rightfully memorialise an African music icon in the form of Dan Tshanda in such a despicable manner,” he said. (ANA)
