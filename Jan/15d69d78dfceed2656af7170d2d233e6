JOHANNESBURG, January 14 – The African National Congress has condemned Kwaito artist Arthur Mafokate, accusing him of storming the stage uninvited and caused mayhem at its manifesto launch rally at the weekend. The statement came after Twitter users took to the platform to condemn actress and women’s rights activist Nomzamo Mbatha for taking a picture at the event with the controversial musician, who has been accused of assaulting his former girlfriend. Mbatha, who was a programme director at the ANC event, said she was taken by surprise into posing for the “selfie”. “While the ANC has worked with and supported Mafokate over many years, however, reports of his alleged abusive conduct towards a female accomplice (SIC) go against the values and policies of the ANC which denounce gender based violence,” the ANC said. “We apologise to Nomzamo Mbatha for any offense this despicable conduct may have caused in the execution of her duties as a programme director. We have full confidence in her activism against gender based violence.” (ANA)
