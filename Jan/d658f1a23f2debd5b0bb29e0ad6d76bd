GABORONE, Jan. 17 – Botswana’s former Director of the Directorate of Intelligence and Security Services (DISS), Isaac Kgosi, was arrested on Tuesday night. Kgosi, who lead the country’s top spy agency since its establishment in 2009 was dismissed under unclear circumstances in May 2018 following the ascendance of Mokgweetsi Masisi to the Presidency, taking over from Seretse Khama Ian Khama. He was arrested upon arrival at the Sir Seretse Khama International Airport (SSKIA) in the capital Gaborone, coming from a holiday in Dubai with his family. The arrest, led by the current DISS Director Fana Magosi who replaced Kgosi, happened in full presence of the local media before he was whisked to a military holding cell where he spent a night. No official charges were revealed during the arrest but it was speculated that he was arrested on tax related charges. Briefing the media on site, DISS Director Fana Magosi said they have a warrant to search all Kgosi’s properties, some of which were outside Gaborone. Kgosi was taken to his house in the suburb of Phakalane in Gaborone on Wednesday morning under heavy security escort where it was revealed that his property was searched. (Xinhua)
