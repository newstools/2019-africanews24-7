JOHANNESBURG, January 18 – Black First Land First on Friday staged a sit-in at the Zondo Commission demanding the immediate suspension of the secretary of the commission, Dr Khotso de Wee. This comes after reports that former Bosasa chief operations officer Angelo Agrizzi, who is currently testifying, will name De Wee as a recipient of cash payments relating to a 2008 tender awarded to Bosasa subsidiary, Sondolo IT, by the department of justice, for the installation of security systems at courts around the country. De Wee was appointed as the secretary for the commission in March 2018, but at the time the tender was awarded he was the chief operations officer at the justice department. The BLF said that it will continue the sit-in until the Zondo Commission suspends De Wee. On Friday, Agrizzi testified among other things that Bosasa had a scheme to defraud the department of correctional services using a frozen chicken supplier as the company had a catering contract with the department. He said Bosasa had to pay its chief accountant, Carlos Bonifacio, R10,000 a month to run this scheme. Bosasa, according to Agrizzi, had at least seven other methods of raising cash, including casual workers and a ghost workers system, running cash bars and canteens at mining hostels, and pay-as-you-go telephones at Lindela Detention Centre.
