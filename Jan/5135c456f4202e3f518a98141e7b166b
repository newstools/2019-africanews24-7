KHUMA, January 24 – Late Bafana Bafana striker Philemon “Chippa” Masinga lived his life to the fullest, mourners heard on Thursday. “My dad died at the age of 49, but he lived his life to the fullest,” his son Sifiso Masinga said at a funeral service held in Khuma, Stilfontein. “His death is not by accident. No measure of profession could have saved my dad. It is God’s will. “No tears could bring my dad back. Tomorrow when you walk down the streets, you must know that you are the daughter of Phil Masinga,” he said to his sisters. Born Philemon Raul Masinga on June 28, 1969, in Khuma, Stilfontein near Klerksdorp, the former Bafana Bafana prolific goal scorer lost his battle against cancer on January 13 at a Johannesburg hospital. Chippa, as he was affectionately known amongst soccer fans, played for Jomo Cosmos and Mamelodi Sundowns in South Africa before he went on to play for Leeds United in England for two years. He played in 39 games for Leeds scoring 11 goals. “Waltzin’ Masinga” as Leeds fans nicknamed him also played for Saint Gallen in Switzerland, Salernitana and Bari in Italy. He appeared 58 times for Bafana Bafana scoring 18 goals. -African News Agency (ANA)
