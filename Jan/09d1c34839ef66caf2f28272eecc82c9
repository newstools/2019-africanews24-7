PRETORIA, January 21 – The inquiry into the fitness to hold office of two top National Prosecuting Authority advocates, Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi, begins on Monday in Centurion. President Cyril Ramaphosa suspended both Jiba and Mrwebi in October 2018 pending the outcome of the inquiry. Jiba is the Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions and Mrwebi the Special Director of Public Prosecutions. The inquiry would look into matters raised on the pair’s conduct in several court cases which involved the General Council of the Bar of South Africa, Freedom Under Law, former president Jacob Zuma, the DA and former KZN Hawks boss Johan Booysen. The courts had made adverse findings against Jiba and Mrwebi, and the latter has taken the bid to strike her off the roll to the Constitutional Court.(ANA)
