JOHANNESBURG, November 1- The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) army has launched a military offensive from Beni in North Kivu province, which borders Uganda and Rwanda, against militia groups that have caused havoc in the east of the country. A military spokesman General Richard Kasonga said rebel positions belonging to — among other militia groups — Ugandan group the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) have been shelled and ground troops engaged in an attempt to eradicate the domestic and regional groups which have destabilised the eastern region for nearly a quarter of a century killings hundreds of people, the BBC reported.
