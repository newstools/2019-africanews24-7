Johannesburg – Veteran 702 presenter Xolani Gwala has lost his battle with stage 4 colon cancer, the radio station announced on Friday morning after hearing from his family. The much-loved veteran talk-radio host was welcomed back with open arms and tears by both colleagues and listeners last year in August when he made his return to the airwaves after nine months when his cancer appeared to have gone into remission. Not many were aware he was once again losing the battle against cancer and he died early on Friday.  BRO!!!  The fight you put up was nothing short of admirable!! You were always selfless and wanting to BE the difference!!! Broadcasting has lost a titan!!
