JOHANNESBURG, November 21 – Old Mutual Limited has apologised for the delay in paying out a funeral claim by the Mtshali family in Stanger, KwaZulu-Natal which led to two members taking the body of the deceased to the company’s offices in a show of protest. A video that went viral on social media showed the two women bring the corpse, in a body-bag, to Old Mutual offices in KwaDukuza, demanding that their claim be paid out. In a statement late on Wednesday, Old Mutual’s managing director of the mass and foundation cluster Clarence Nethengwe said the delayed was not due to the company doubting that a death had occurred, but rather due to the claim being referred for further individual assessment. The funeral claim was lodged on November 11 and paid out on November 15. “We are deeply sorry for the delay. We are committed to doing better and we will be taking steps to accelerate and improve the way we verify those claims that need to be assessed further,” Nethengwe said. “Although most claims are paid on time, and delays are rare, it is clear that we need to make our additional claims assessment processes easier and faster to ensure we do not let any of our customers down in their time of greatest need. While more than 99 percent of our valid funeral claims are paid out within the contracted 48 hours, we must strive to make that 100 percent. – African News Agency (ANA)
