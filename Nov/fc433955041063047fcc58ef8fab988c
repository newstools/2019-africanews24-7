After Mauricio Pochettino was somewhat surprisingly sacked on Tuesday, Jose Mourinho has been officially announced as his replacement on Wednesday morning. Pochettino was relieved of his duties in news that shocked the football world after a string of poor results has seen Spurs drop to 14th place in the Premier League. The Argentine had been in charge of the Lillywhites since May 2014 and guided them to the UEFA Champions League final last season. Spurs confirmed that Mourinho will take over after talks between chairman Daniel Levy and Mourinho’s camp went well over night. “In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football,” Levy told the club’s official website. “He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.” Mourinho had been out of work since being fired by Manchester United in December 2018, but Spurs are now his third English side following stints with Chelsea and the Red Devils. He signed a contract until the end of the 2022/23 season and will sit on the bench for Spurs’ clash with West Ham United on Saturday. Pochettino left Spurs after being in charge for 293 games, winning 160 but failing to add silverware to the club’s trophy cabinet.
