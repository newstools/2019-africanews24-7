Wellington, July 16 – New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Tuesday said she “completely and utterly” disagreed with US President Donald Trump’s racist tweets against four non-white Democratic Congresswomen. In an interview with state broadcaster Radio New Zealand, Ardern said she was proud that in her country, Parliament was meant to represent “a range of different cultures and ethnicities”, adding that “never should a judgment be made about the origin of anyone, and their right therefore to be in parliament as a representative”, Efe news reported. “We should celebrate our diversity, we do in New Zealand, I’m proud of that and so I obviously take a very different view to President Trump,” the Prime Minister added. Ardern joined a flurry of criticism within the US and by some international leaders directed Donald Trump, who had tweeted on Sunday that the four Congresswomen — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley — should “go back” to the countries they came from and falsely implying that they were not natural-born American citizens. –IANS
