RUSTENBURG, May 1 – The Minister of mineral resources Gwede Mantashe on Wednesday appealed for vigilance for the health and safety  of mineworkers following an incident at Sibanye-Stillwater’s platinum mine. About 1,800 miners at Sibanye’s Thembelani shaft in Rustenburg were safely hoisted to the surface from the 14th level on Tuesday night after they were trapped for hours underground. On Tuesday, day shift employees were kept waiting underground after rails which were being transported underground, whilst being slung under the conveyance, came loose and fell down the shaft. Mantashe commended the successful rescue of the mineworkers using an alternative exit route for them to return to the surface without any injuries reported. “Despite strides made on health and safety thus far, we should not be complacent. We are committed to the goal of zero harm at work. Every worker must return home safe,” Mantashe said. The department of mineral resources said it will commence with a comprehensive investigation into the matter. Sibanye said further inspections “on the shaft infrastructure below 15th level will follow now that all employees have been accounted for.” The mineral resource at Sibanye’s Thembelani mine is accessed from the surface using conventional underground mining methods approximately 2,1km below surface.
