PRETORIA, February 2 â€“ Mamelodi Sundowns moved to the top of the CAF Champions League Group A standings after defeating Ivory Coast domestic champions ASEC Mimosas 3-1 at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria on Friday evening. It took Sundowns just nine minutes to undo the Ivorian defence after Mosa Lebusa headed home from an excellent cross provided by Uruguayan midfielder Gaston Sirino. However five minutes later, Lebusa turned from hero to villain when he committed a foul in the penalty area, allowing defender Mediomo Diomande to level matters with the spot-kick. Sundowns pressed hard to regain the advantage but goal-bound efforts by Anthony Lafford, Lyle Lakay and Sirino, were well handled by Mimosas No 1 Abdoul Karim Cisse. The hosts did eventually get the breakthrough in the 54th minute, when Sirino was again the provider, to allow Themba Zwane to put Sundowns 2-1 ahead. Second half substitute, Emiliano Tade, who was recently signed from Amazulu, produced the perfect debut performance in slotting home the third goal for his new team deep into second-half time added on. This time Zwane was the man to set up the opportunity for the Argentinian forward. The win will have boosted the confidence of the Chloorkop-based side, went into the match off back-to-back Nedbank Cup and Absa Premiership losses to Baroka FC and Amazulu respectively. The positive result was the second in as many Champions League matches for Sundowns, following their recent 2-1 home win over Wydad Casablanca. The Brazilians, as Sundowns are known, were beaten 2-1 by Lobi Stars in Nigeria in their opening group fixture. Sundowns will return to domestic league action on Wednesday when they host Black Leopards, before travelling to Abidjan to take on Mimosas in their next Champions League group encounter on February 12.
