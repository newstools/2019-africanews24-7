Sello Theletsane JOHANNESBURG- The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has criticized minister Tito Mboweni over his dismissal comments on the resolution to nationalise the Reserve Bank. This comes after the finance minister said that the SARB operates independently without fear, favour or prejudice, provided there is regular consultation with him as the minister. “The EFF condemns the comments by Minister of Finance who is dismissing the resolutions for the nationalisation of the South African Reserve Bank. Mboweni has an irritating and outrightly arrogant tendency of thinking he is above the collective political will of the people. He acts like a paragon of wisdom as if he is omniscient on economic matters”, the EFF said in a statement. “It is a proven fact that his economic thinking and ideas, which have characterised the macroeconomic policies of the successive ANC government over 25 years have dismally failed to create jobs, alleviate poverty and reduce inequalities. Mboweni and his gang of neoliberals in the ANC should take seriously what Albert Einstein said about insanity; doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results. After twenty-five years of neoliberal policies and practices, it is pure insanity to still arrogantly demand the country to implement what has obviously failed.” The EFF added that it reiterates that the South African Reserve Bank ought to be nationalised. “Private interests must be cut off completely to allow the bank to fully belong to the South African public and not private individuals who through shares, contribute to influencing the strategic direction of the bank, limited as their representation is.” In conclusion, the EFF further said it would table a bill to realise the nationalisation of the bank when the sixth Parliament reopens.
