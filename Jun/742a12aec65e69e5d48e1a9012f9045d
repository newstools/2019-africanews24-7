JOHANNESBURG, June 11 – Former Minister of Women in the Presidency Bathabile Dlamini on Tuesday resigned from her position as a member of parliament for the African National Congress. Dlamini, who is one of 14 former ministers who did not make it back into the Cabinet, did not give reasons for quitting as MP. But in her letter to the ANC she says: “We must all be worried about the expediency that has been done within the aim of discrediting some of us. I hold no grudge for being reshuffled and not being appointed”. Dlamini, who is the head of the ANC Women’s League, thanked the party for the opportunity to “serve the nation”. – African News Agency (ANA)
