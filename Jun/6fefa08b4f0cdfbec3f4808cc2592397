JOHANNESBURG- The Democratic Alliance (DA) has on Monday called on Gauteng MEC for COGTA and Human Settlements, Lebohang Maile to investigate the allegations of corruption involving a multi-million rand contract in Lesedi Municipality. This comes after Africa News 24-7 broke the story of the Lesedi Municipality acting municipal manager, Gugu Thimane, who is accused of being the mastermind behind the awarding of R50m security tender to security company Bravo Span 90cc, abusing in the process Section 32 of the Regulations under the Municipal Finance Management Act. According to the DA, MEC Maile must investigate whether the awarding of this tender by Thimane was irregular and whether proper tender processes were followed. “We call for the immediate suspension of Thimane while the investigation is pending. The DA will table questions in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature to ascertain the following: whether this security tender was advertised, if the proper tender process was followed and what role Thimane played in awarding this tender.” the Democratic Alliance said. “Corruption and tender irregularities are criminal acts and have bankrupted most of our district municipalities”. In conclusion, the Democratic Alliance further added that should it be found that due process was not followed in awarding this tender, then those implicated and who benefitted illegally must face the full might of the law.
