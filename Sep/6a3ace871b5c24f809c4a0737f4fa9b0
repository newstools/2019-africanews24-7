JOHANNESBURG, September 5 – Police have arrested two women and a man in connection with the kidnapping of six-year-old  Amy-Lee de Jager in front of her school in Vanderbijlpark in Gauteng. Police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said one of the suspects was known to the parents of the little girl, who has since been released. “She was released unharmed by her kidnappers during the early hours of (Tuesday) morning after the kidnappers knew that the net was closing in on them,” Naidoo said. “However, the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences unit continued with the investigations and arrested the three suspects, one of whom, who is female, is known to the parents of Amy-Lee.” The 50-year-old man and the women aged 27 and 40 were arrested at their homes on Wednesday night. De Jager was abducted by men driving a Toyota Fortuner as her mother dropped her off at school on Monday. The vehicle was caught on CCTV cameras situated opposite the school gates. The kidnappers had demanded a R 2 million ransom but released the Grade R pupil the following day, dropping her off close to The Shakespeare Inn hotel in Vanderbijlpark. Police commissioner General Khehla John Sitole praised the investigators handling the case for their commitment. “(They) have worked around the clock ever since Amy-Lee’s kidnapping was reported to us and such dedication is very encouraging,” Sitole said. – African News Agency (ANA)
