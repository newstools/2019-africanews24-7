DURBAN, September 5 – The South African Post Office has condemned the killing of UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana and confirmed it had launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the employment of an implicated postal worker. The young woman went missing on August 24. It was learnt last week that she had been raped and beaten to death with a scale inside the Clareinch Post Office by an employee, and her body then dumped in Lingelethu West. “The Post Office Board was horrified and dismayed by the news of the brutal murder of Ms. Uyinene Mrwetyana at the Clareinch Post Office. What is even more saddening is that our own Post Office employee is involved in this heinous crime. The Board and management of the Post Office condemn in the strongest terms this horrific incident as it does not represent the values espoused by the organisation,” said board member Dr. Charles Nwaila. From the moment that the “gruesome incident” came to light, the SA Post Office management and staff had been actively involved in assisting the police with the investigation, said Nwaila. The board had convened a dedicated subcommittee to investigate the circumstances surrounding the appointment of the implicated employee, he said. Once the investigation was completed, its findings would be submitted to the minister of communications and digital technologies. “The scourge of violence against women and children affecting our society has to come to an end. The Post Office is committed to collaborate with all stakeholders to find a sustainable solution. “We extend our sincere condolences to the Mrwetyana family for the loss of their beloved daughter. Our sympathies also go to Uyinene’s friends and her fellow University of Cape Town students. The Post Office Board will not be making any further comments on the statement,” said Nwaila. – African News Agency (ANA)
