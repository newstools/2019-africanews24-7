JOHANNESBURG, September 18 – The Kofi Annan International Peace Keeping Training Centre (KAIPTC) has discussed evolving trends in peace and security in Africa at the first meeting of the Kofi Annan Peace and Security (KAPS) Forum in Accra, Ghana. Tuesday’s meeting themed ‘Peace Operations in the Context of Violent Extremism in Africa’ was attended by Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo and Mohamed Ibn Chambas, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and Head of the UN Office for West Africa and Sahel (UNOWAS). Addressing delegates at the opening ceremony, the Commandant of KAIPTC, Air Vice Marshall Griffiths S. Evans shared the rationale behind the forum. “The forum seeks to provide a platform for robust engagement on critical peace and security issues affecting the African continent. Our actions are guided by our mission to foster peace and stability through the provision of a globally-recognised capacity and policy support for all actors on African peace and security issues,” he stated. Akufo-Addo identified key interventions which could be implemented to tackle violent extremism, including promoting and developing a system and culture of accountable governance, free of corruption, whereby people are governed in accordance with the rule of law, respect for individual liberties and human rights, and the principles of democratic accountability. Other high-level dignitaries attending the forum included leaders from Burundi, the Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Nigeria. The forum also brought together over 200 high-level delegates and diplomats from governmental and intergovernmental organisations (including the African Union and its Regional Economic Communities, United Nations and European Union). – African News Agency (ANA)
