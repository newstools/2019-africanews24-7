Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG- The Economic Freedom Fighters has rejected Eyewitness News’ apology after its journalist, Barry Bateman, used foul language against the party’s leader Julius Malema at a press briefing on Tuesday. This comes after Eyewitness News apologized to Malema after Bateman called him a “p**s” at an impromptu press briefing outside the Hawks offices where he was summoned to appear over allegations that he fired a rifle in public. “We have long warned that journalists are responsible for the toxic environment that the EFF operates in, within the media generally. One must simply imagine what would have happened had the EFF responded to Bateman on the scene to his naked provocation. It is obvious that many would blame the efF for being intolerant of the media and suppressing media freedom. “It is obvious that Bateman could swear at the EFF President Julius Malema because South African journalism has allowed, condoned and promoted bias reporters who have descended to the arena,” The EFF said. According to EWN, Bateman has since been taken off air immediately after they were made aware of the video. Furthermore, EWN said that it will hold an internal probe that will deal with the matter appropriately.
