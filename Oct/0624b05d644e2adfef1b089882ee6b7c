DURBAN, October 30 – AfriForum’s private prosecution of National Assembly speaker Thandi Modise for animal cruelty has been postponed to March 2020. Modise appeared in the Potchefstroom Regional Court on Wednesday on charges of animal cruelty. The case was provisionally postponed to March 24 to 27, when Modise will plead to the charges and the trial will start. The final date for the hearing will be determined at the end of next week when Modise will have received her parliamentary programme. “AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit welcomes the fact that a date has now been set for the trial so that Modise can finally answer for this cruel case of animal abuse. “Not even the Speaker of Parliament should be able to evade prosecution merely because she is a high-placed political figure. Our involvement underlines the respect that we have for the selfless work of the NSPCA,” said Elias Maangwale, an investigator at AfriForum’s private prosecution unit. In July 2014, the NSPCA responded to a complaint at a farm where they found over 50 carcasses of pigs and other animals. The surviving animals were severely starved and dehydrated, it was reported at the time. 162 animals had to be euthanised. It was later determined the farm belonged to Modise. The National Prosecuting Authority refused to prosecute Modise, leading AfriForum to take up the case. – African News Agency (ANA)
