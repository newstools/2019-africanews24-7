PRETORIA, 24 October – The Equality Court sitting at the High Court in Pretoria on Thursday dismissed an application brought by the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) to interdict the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Julius Malema and his followers from intimidating and harassing journalists. Sanef and journalists Barry Bateman from Eyewitness News, Pauli van Wyk of the Daily Maverick, Adriaan Basson from News24, veteran journalist Max du Preez as well as Ranjeni Munusamy from the Sunday Times, had asked the court to interdict Malema and his supporters from intimidating journalists on public and social media platforms. They claimed Malema was engaging in hate speech. The forum also wanted the court to order the EFF to publicly apologise to journalists listed as complainants in the case. During arguments which were heard over two days, Advocate Daniel Burger, for Sanef, said the EFF and Malema had created an environment that was hostile towards journalists. Berger said Malema’s words were intimidating and were also a call to violence. He argued that Malema, as a leader, had to know that what he says has consequences and sets a precedent for his followers. Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, for Malema, defended his client by claiming that “no reasonable person” would take Malema’s rhetoric seriously. He argued that the EFF has always been vocal about non-violence, and he warned the courts against stripping the party and its leaders of freedom of speech. – African News Agency (ANA)
