Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG- The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Gauteng has said that they reject Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula’s call for people to pay e-tolls. This comes after Mbalula’s comments during a briefing on the aviation industry on Thursday after planes were grounded earlier this week, Mbalula urged motorists to pay for the use of roads. “Across our system, we have found that the user-pays principle is direct, targeted, fairer and extremely efficient,” Mbalula said. The lack of proper communication on e-tolls, for instance, may have played a role in the slow take-up by road users, Mbalula said. According to the EFF, the ANC government had promised Gauteng people on several occasions, such as during the 2016 local government elections, that it would do away with e-tolls. “Yet its national ministers always contradict this, stating that paying e-tolls is government policy,” the EFF said. “The e-tolls must be boycotted until the government finds a solution other than making ordinary citizens pay. “The people already pay for water, electricity and ever-increasing petrol prices. Why must the government impose on them another tariff that came out of the greed and corrupt interests of politicians? E-tolls must fall,” the party’s spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, said.
