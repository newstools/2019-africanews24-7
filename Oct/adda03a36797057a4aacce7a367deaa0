JOHANNESBURG, October 25 – President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Saturday launch the Hillside View integrated housing project in Bloemfontein, which was initiated in 2016 as part of the government’s commitment to providing decent accommodation in Mangaung, his office said on Friday. The development consists of 50 homes for military veterans, 18 land restitution units, 532 new houses under the ‘breaking new ground’ scheme and 250 bonded houses. “The bonded houses address the need for first-time homebuyers in the gap market and these units are bought through the Finance Linked Individual Subsidy Programme,” the presidency said in a statement. The housing development is located near social amenities such as schools, clinics, police stations and places of employment. Ramaphosa will also hand over title deeds during the event. The government says the department of human settlements has to date delivered over four million housing opportunities for South Africans. “The houses to be handed over on Saturday will be an addition to over 300,000 houses already delivered by the Free State provincial government over the past few years,” the presidency said. – African News Agency (ANA)
