CAPE TOWN, August 19 – Former Orlando Pirates head coach Milutin ‘Micho’ Sredojevic has denied reports that he sexually harassed a hotel cleaner in South Africa Sredojevic sensationally resigned from his post at Pirates last Friday evening – day before The Buccaneers were due to play an MTN8 quarterfinal. It was reported that he needed to return home to Serbia to be with his ill mother, although there has also been speculation that he is to join Egyptian giants Zamalek. Then, it was claimed on Sunday by a South African publication that Sredojevic may have to face criminal charges after allegedly making advances at a hotel cleaner. The 51-year-old former Uganda coach dismissed this story as untrue. “This is a shame. My lawyers will be dealing with this. I have been the most respectful person, soldier, and servant of the game. I don’t deserve this. It is baseless and unfair,” he told Soccer Laduma. “I am still in pain and with my bedridden mother. I am lucky I am out of the country, this is unbelievable set up to chase me out. I don’t know who she (the accuser) is,” he added. Meanwhile, reports on Monday morning claimed that Sredojevic has already arrived in Cairo to take charge at Zamalek. One website quoted him as saying: “Zamalek is a special club that you fall in love with as soon as you enter it. I want to work hard in order to achieve the fans’ goals.” There were also photographs on Twitter supposedly showing Micho arriving at Cairo airport. However, it’s worth bearing in mind that the Serbian would have travelled to Egypt in the past – and as such, these photos could have been dated. Despite there being no mention of Sredojevic on Zamalek’s Twitter or Facebook pages, there was an entry on Monday morning on their official website claiming the Serb ‘was happy to take over’. It’s therefore possible that Sredojevic has agreed in principle to take the job, but that the terms of his contract have not yet been agreed. – African News Agency (ANA)
