JOHANNESBURG, August 17 – Former Orlando Pirates coach Milutin Sredojević, who sensationally quit the club on Friday night, is reportedly on his way to Egypt’s legendary club Zamalek. According to an Egyptian website kingfut.com, Sredojević, known as Micho, has been appointed as coach and will arrive at the club on Sunday. Pirates lost 3-0 defeat to SuperSport United on Wednesday and the coach tendered his resignation to Pirates on Friday, on of eve of their MTN8 quarterfinal match against Highlands Park at the Orlando Stadium in Soweto. Zamalek have been searching for a new manager since the sacking of Khaled Galal last month after losing to fierce rivals Al Ahly. Club president Mortada Mansour originally said that that Zamalek had hired Serbian head coach Aleksandar Stanojević as their new manager but two days later he changed his mind, announcing Sredojević would take control. Speaking on Saturday, Mansour said: “Micho was our first choice. Tarek Yehia (current interim manager) will be his assistant, Ayman Abdelaziz will be appointed as team coordinator, and Amir Mortada will continue in his role as director of football.” Asked about the reason behind announcing Stanojević as the club’s new manager, he said: “Stanojević will not take charge of Zamalek. It was a trick to find out who the club’s enemies are and I revealed them in front of everyone.” Mansour said Sredojević would arrive in Egypt on Sunday to sign his contract, before leading the team in the Caf Champions League and the Egypt Cup. – African News Agency (ANA)
